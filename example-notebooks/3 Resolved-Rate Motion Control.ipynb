    "The `roboticstoolbox` package provides many ways of interfacing with a robot and performing dynamic or kinematic operations. In Notebooks 1 and 2 we used the `ET` and `ETS` classes. These provide a low level kinematic-only representation of a robot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Robots contain more information than just kinematic data (which is all that the ETS stores). For example, they may contain dynamic data (mass, inertia, centre of gravity etc.) and geometric data. The `Link` class is used to hold this data for a single link within a manipulator. A `Link` contains an `ETS` which is used to represent the kinematics of that link.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `Robot` class as a high level way of representing a whole robot along with all data. A `Robot` class instance contains a tree structure to represent how links are connected. Links can only have up to one parent but unlimited children. With this structure, we can represent serial-link manipulators (such as the Panda), branched mechanisms (such as the YuMi two armed manipulator), but not mechanisms which form closed loops in their structure.  The `Robot` instance may also hold additional data such as known joint configurations and the robot's pose relative to the world-frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "A robot will typically contain an end-effector or gripper. We represent these using the `Gripper` class. A `Robot` contains a list of grippers under the `Robot.grippers` attribute. Each `Gripper` contains its own tree structure of `Link` objects (Think of a `Gripper` as a mini `Robot`).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can convert a section or a sequence of a `Robot` to an `ETS` using the `Robot.ets(start, end)` method. The `start` argument defaults to the base link of the robot. The `end` link will default to the first gripper if present, otherwise the first leaf of the link tree. Otherwise `start` and `end` may be a `str` representing the name of the desired link or a reference to the desired link. Note that the referenced link must be within the robot or its grippers. There are no other limits on `start` and `end`, for example `start` could be after `end` in the chain or even from one branch to another (think of going from the link from the left gripper to the right gripper on the YuMi). \n",
    "\n",
    "Within the `roboticstoolbox`, we have many defined robots. These can be accessed from the `.models` namespace.\n"
